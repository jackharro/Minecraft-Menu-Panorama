• Currently, the faces of the panorama do not play nicely.
1. Play around with the FOV in 1080x1080 resolution
    • May have to use standard resolution with square cropping
2. Can clouds be paused with carpet?

3. Increase the chunk range by loading in 1.7 then making a map then changing the biomes back (lots of work)
